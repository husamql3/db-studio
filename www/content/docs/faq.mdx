# Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordions>

<Accordion id="security" title="Is my database connection safe? Do you store or track it?">

**Yes, completely safe!** DB Studio runs entirely on your computer and is fully open source.

- No tracking or data collection
- Nothing is sent to the internet
- Everything runs locally on your machine
- You can review all the code: [github.com/husamql3/db-studio](https://github.com/husamql3/db-studio)

Feel free to check the code yourself to be sure.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="prisma-compat" title="Can I use DB Studio with Prisma?">

Yes! Just run `npx db-studio` in your Prisma project folder. It will automatically use your existing `DATABASE_URL` from `.env`.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="drizzle-compat" title="Can I use DB Studio with Drizzle?">

Yes! Run `npx db-studio` in your Drizzle project folder. It uses the same `DATABASE_URL` from your `.env` file. No extra setup needed.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="multiple-databases" title="Can I connect to multiple databases?">

Yes, you have two options:

**Option 1: Multiple databases on the same server**

DB Studio lets you switch between databases on the same host directly in the UI.

**Option 2: Run multiple instances**

Open different terminals with different ports and env files:

```bash
# Dev database (terminal 1)
npx db-studio --env .env.dev --port 3333

# Production database (terminal 2)
npx db-studio --env .env.prod --port 3334
```

Or use direct connection strings:

```bash
npx db-studio --database-url postgresql://localhost:5432/devdb --port 3333
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="connection-issues" title="Connection not working?">

First, check if your connection works:

```bash
npx db-studio --status
```

Common problems and fixes:

- **No .env file found** - Make sure `.env` exists in your current folder or a parent folder
- **Wrong URL format** - Should be: `postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname`
- **Database not running** - Check if your database server is started
- **Network blocked** - Check firewall or network settings

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="port-already-in-use" title="Port 3333 is already in use?">

Use a different port:

```bash
npx db-studio --port 4000
# or
npx db-studio --port 8080
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="env-file-location" title="Where should I put my .env file?">

DB Studio looks for `.env` in:

1. Your current folder
2. Parent folders (it searches upward)

You can also:
- Specify a file: `npx db-studio --env .env.local`
- Use a different variable: `npx db-studio --var-name MY_DB_URL`
- Skip the file entirely: `npx db-studio --database-url "postgresql://..."`

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="production-use" title="Can I use this in production?">

You can, but we recommend using DB Studio only for:

- Local development
- Staging environments
- Debugging

**If you use it with production databases:**

- Never expose the web interface to the public internet
- Use SSH tunnels or VPN to connect
- Use strong passwords and limited database permissions
- Treat it like an admin tool, not a public app

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="ai-assistant" title="How does the AI assistant work?">

The AI assistant helps you ask questions about your data in plain English. It:

- Uses your database schema to understand your tables
- Gives you helpful answers about your data
- Limited to 5 messages per day

</Accordion>

**Export data:**
- CSV format
