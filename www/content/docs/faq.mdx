# Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordions>

<Accordion id="security" title="Is my database URL safe? Are you storing or tracking it?">

**Absolutely safe!** DB Studio is completely open source and runs **entirely locally**.

- No data collection or telemetry
- No information is sent over the internet
- The server, frontend, and DB connection all run on your machine
- Full source code available: [github.com/husamql3/db-studio](https://github.com/husamql3/db-studio)

You can (and should!) audit the code yourself.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="prisma-compat" title="Can I use DB Studio with Prisma projects?">

Yes — perfectly!  
Just run `npx db-studio` in your Prisma project directory — it will use the existing `DATABASE_URL`.

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="multiple-databases" title="How do I connect to multiple databases?">

Run multiple instances with different ports/env files:

```bash
# Dev database
npx db-studio -e .env.dev -p 3333

# Prod database (different terminal)
npx db-studio -e .env.prod -p 3334
```

Or use direct URLs:

```bash
npx db-studio -d postgresql://localhost:5432/devdb -p 3333
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="connection-issues" title="Having connection issues?">

Try:

```bash
npx db-studio --status
```

Common fixes:

- Check `.env` exists in current directory
- Verify URL format: `postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname`
- Database server is running?
- Firewall/network allows connection?

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="port-already-in-use" title="Port already in use error?">

Just choose another port:

```bash
npx db-studio -p 4000
# or
npx db-studio --port 8080
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion id="production-use" title="Can I use DB Studio in production?">

Technically yes, but **we strongly recommend** using it only for:

- Development
- Staging
- Local debugging

**Production recommendations**:

- Never expose the web interface publicly
- Use SSH tunnels / VPN when connecting to prod
- Strong credentials & limited permissions
- Treat it as an admin tool, not a public dashboard
