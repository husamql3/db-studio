Switching to **DB Studio** is extremely simple — in most cases you can just replace the command.

### 1. From Prisma Studio


```json title="package.json"
// [!code --]
"studio": "npx prisma studio"
// [!code ++]
"studio": "npx db-studio"
```

That's it!  
DB Studio automatically uses the same `DATABASE_URL` from your `.env` file that Prisma uses.

**Advantages over Prisma Studio:**

- Better performance (optimized data loading)
- Modern, more responsive UI
- Works with **any** PostgreSQL database — not just Prisma projects
- No schema.prisma dependency
- Real-time updates & better filtering/search

### 2. From Drizzle Studio

```json title="package.json"
// [!code --]
"studio": "npx drizzle-kit studio"
// [!code ++]
"studio": "npx db-studio"
```

Again — it will pick up your `DATABASE_URL` automatically.

**Bonus**: DB Studio offers a more spreadsheet-like experience, bulk editing capabilities, and a cleaner interface.
